# homebrew-mommy
homebrew formula for [mommy](https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy)~ ❤️

see [mommy](https://github.com/FWDekker/mommy) for installation instructions~

## development
the formula can be updated to distribute mommy version `<version>` by running `./update.sh <version>`~

this is automated by a github action, which should be triggered manually after each release of mommy by going to
[the `update` action](https://github.com/FWDekker/homebrew-mommy/actions/workflows/update.yml), clicking `run workflow`,
then clicking the other `run workflow`, and checking the pull request that is automatically created~

## acknowledgements
